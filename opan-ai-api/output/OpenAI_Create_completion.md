# [Create completion Legacy](/docs/api-reference/completions/create)
post https://api.openai.com/v1/completions 
Creates a completion for the provided prompt and parameters. 
## Request body 
| Parameter | Type   | Required | Description|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| model | string | Required | ID of the model to use. You can use the                   List models API                   to see all of your available models, or see our                   Model overview for                   descriptions of them.| 
| prompt | string or array | Required | The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a                   string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token                   arrays.                                     Note that <|endoftext|> is the document separator that                   the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not                   specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of                   a new document.| 
| best_of | integer or null | Optional | Generates best_of completions server-side and                   returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability                   per token). Results cannot be streamed.                                     When used with n, best_of controls                   the number of candidate completions and                   n specifies how many to return –                   best_of must be greater than n.                   Note: Because this parameter generates many                   completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use                   carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for                   max_tokens and stop.| 
| echo | boolean or null | Optional | Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion| 
| frequency_penalty | number or null | Optional | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new                   tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far,                   decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line                   verbatim.                   See more information about frequency and presence                     penalties.| 
| logit_bias | map | Optional | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the                   completion.                                     Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their                   token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value                   from -100 to 100. You can use this                   tokenizer tool to convert                   text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the                   logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact                   effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should                   decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100                   or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the                   relevant token.                                     As an example, you can pass {"50256": -100} to                   prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.| 
| logprobs | integer or null | Optional | Include the log probabilities on the                   logprobs most likely output tokens, as well the                   chosen tokens. For example, if logprobs is 5, the                   API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API                   will always return the logprob of the sampled                   token, so there may be up to logprobs+1 elements                   in the response.                  The maximum value for logprobs is 5.| 
| max_tokens | integer or null | Optional | The maximum number of tokens that can                   be generated in the completion.                                     The token count of your prompt plus                   max_tokens cannot exceed the model's context                   length.                   Example Python code                   for counting tokens.| 
| n | integer or null | Optional | How many completions to generate for each prompt.  Note: Because this parameter generates many                   completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use                   carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for                   max_tokens and stop.| 
| presence_penalty | number or null | Optional | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new                   tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far,                   increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.                   See more information about frequency and presence                     penalties.| 
| seed | integer or null | Optional | If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample                   deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same                   seed and parameters should return the same                   result.                                     Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the                   system_fingerprint response parameter to monitor                   changes in the backend.| 
| stop | string / array / null | Optional | Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further                   tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.| 
| stream | boolean or null | Optional | Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will                   be sent as data-only                   server-sent events                   as they become available, with the stream terminated by a                   data: [DONE] message.                   Example Python code.| 
| stream_options | object or null | Optional | Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set                   stream: true.| 
| suffix | string or null | Optional | The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.                                     This parameter is only supported for                   gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct.| 
| temperature | number or null | Optional | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher                   values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower                   values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.                                     We generally recommend altering this or top_p but                   not both.| 
| top_p | number or null | Optional | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus                   sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens                   with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens                   comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.                                     We generally recommend altering this or                   temperature but not both.| 
| user | string | Optional | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help                   OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse.                   Learn more.|
