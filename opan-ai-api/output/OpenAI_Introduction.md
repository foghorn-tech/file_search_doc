# [Introduction](/docs/api-reference/introduction)
You can interact with the API through HTTP requests from any language,
        via our official Python bindings, our official Node.js library, or a
        [community-maintained library](/docs/libraries/community-libraries). 
To install the official Python bindings, run the following command: 

```python
pip install openai
```
To install the official Node.js library, run the following command in
        your Node.js project directory: 

```python
npm install openai@^4.0.0
```
