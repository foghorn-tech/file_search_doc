# Vision

Learn how to use vision capabilities to understand images.

## Introduction

Both GPT-4o and GPT-4 Turbo have vision capabilities, meaning the models can take in images and answer questions about them.

## Quick start

Images are made available to the model in two main ways: by passing a link to the image or by passing the base64 encoded image directly in the request. Images can be passed in the `user` messages.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4o",
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "text", "text": "Whatâ€™s in this image?"},
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": {
            "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg",
          },
        },
      ],
    }
  ],
  max_tokens=300,
)

print(response.choices[0])
```

The model is best at answering general questions about what is present in the images. While it does understand the relationship between objects in images, it is not yet optimized to answer detailed questions about the location of certain objects in an image. For example, you can ask it what color a car is or what some ideas for dinner might be based on what is in you fridge, but if you show it an image of a room and ask it where the chair is, it may not answer the question correctly.
