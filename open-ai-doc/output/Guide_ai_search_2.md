# Search the web using OpenAI

Revised Process
1. Initialize the OpenAI client and set the API key.
2. Use a web crawler or a search engine API (e.g., Google Custom Search API or Bing Search API) to perform the web search.
3. Save the retrieved search results to a file (e.g., JSON or CSV format).
4. Create a vector store to store and retrieve embedding vectors.
5. Upload the saved search results file to OpenAI's vector store.
6. Create an assistant with a code interpreter and vector search tools.
7. Create a new conversation thread.
8. Add the user's query to the conversation thread.
9. Run the assistant to process the user's query.
10. Display the results generated by the assistant.
