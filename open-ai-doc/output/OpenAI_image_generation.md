# Image generation

Learn how to generate images with DALL路E in the openai API.

## Usage

### Generations

By default, images are generated at `standard` quality, but when using DALL路E 3 you can set `quality: "hd"` for enhanced detail. Square, standard quality images are the fastest to generate.

You can request 1 image at a time with DALL路E 3 (request more by making parallel requests) or up to 10 images at a time using DALL路E 2 with the n parameter.

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.images.generate(
  model="dall-e-3",
  prompt="a white siamese cat",
  size="1024x1024",
  quality="standard",
  n=1,
)

image_url = response.data[0].url
```
