# Code Interpreter

## openai

1. Write and run Python code in a sandboxed execution environment.
2. Process files with diverse data and formatting, and generate files with data and images of graphs.

Code Interpreter allows your Assistant to run code iteratively to solve challenging code and math problems. When your Assistant writes code that fails to run, it can iterate on this code by attempting to run different code until the code execution succeeds.
