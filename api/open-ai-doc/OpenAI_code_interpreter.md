# Code Interpreter

The Code Interpreter enables Assistants to execute Python code in a secure sandbox, handling various data formats and creating graphs. It facilitates iterative code adjustments to tackle complex coding and mathematical issues, ensuring successful execution.

## Enabling Code Interpreter
Pass code_interpreter in the tools parameter of the Assistant object to enable Code Interpreter:

```python
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
  instructions="You are a personal math tutor. When asked a math question, write and run code to answer the question.",
  model="gpt-4o",
  tools=[{"type": "code_interpreter"}]
)
```

## Passing files to Code Interpreter

```python
# Upload a file with an "assistants" purpose
file = client.files.create(
  file=open("mydata.csv", "rb"),
  purpose='assistants'
)

# Create an assistant using the file ID
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
  instructions="You are a personal math tutor. When asked a math question, write and run code to answer the question.",
  model="gpt-4o",
  tools=[{"type": "code_interpreter"}],
  tool_resources={
    "code_interpreter": {
      "file_ids": [file.id]
    }
  }
)

```

Files can be shared at the thread level, accessible only within that thread. Upload via the File upload endpoint and include the File ID in the Message creation request.

```python
thread = client.beta.threads.create(
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I need to solve the equation `3x + 11 = 14`. Can you help me?",
      "attachments": [
        {
          "file_id": file.id,
          "tools": [{"type": "code_interpreter"}]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
)
```
