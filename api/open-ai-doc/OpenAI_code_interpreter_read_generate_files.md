# Reading images and files generated by Code Interpreter
Code Interpreter in the API also outputs files, such as generating image diagrams, CSVs, and PDFs. There are two types of files that are generated:

```json
{
    "id": "msg_abc123",
    "object": "thread.message",
    "created_at": 1698964262,
    "thread_id": "thread_abc123",
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": [
    {
      "type": "image_file",
      "image_file": {
        "file_id": "file-abc123"
      }
    }
  ]
  #...
}
```

The file content can then be downloaded by passing the file ID to the Files API:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

image_data = client.files.content("file-abc123")
image_data_bytes = image_data.read()

with open("./my-image.png", "wb") as file:
    file.write(image_data_bytes)
```
